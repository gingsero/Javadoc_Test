A Study of Javadoc

Javadoc is a tool made software developer convenient.
But this tool should be considered seriously to use project.
I'm writing type of projects that can use javadoc or should.

1. Java library obfuscated
2. For internal company source sharing
3. For external customer
4. Private..

I think that javadoc is only fit for 'Number 1(Java library obfuscated)'.
